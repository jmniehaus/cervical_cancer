    "# Disclosure on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this post are on high-risk gynecological patients at a Venezuelan hospital, and are from the UCI machine learning repository, available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29). No information is provided on how the data were gathered, or when. Thus, the data are not representative of women in general, or even high-risk gynecological patients. The data were selected based on their perceived risk for cervical complications; thus, models trained on the data are only valid on similarly selected test data going forward. Moreover, the data dictionary for these data is unfortunately quite lacking with the published work using these data not helping much either. The authors of the data have two published articles where they give some additional information. These articles are available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7924508/pdf/peerj-cs-04-154.pdf) and [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-58838-4_27). Other's have also used the data, but either offer no additional details or make claims about the data that are not verifiable with materials provided by the original authors. A quick search on Google Scholar will show several papers citing the original paper, most of which use so-called \"garbage can\" models, with minimal or no interrogation of the source data. Several have data leakage, fail to address imbalance, and use high accuracy scores as evidence of a good classifier (despite imbalance). Thus, both because of the fact that I am not a doctor, and because the data used in this post are shakey at best, this post should be seen as an exercise in the data science process, and any publications using the data should be viewed with heavy skepticism. The results in this post should not be used for any medical decisions, and do not constitute medical advice; they are merely used to showcase data science techniques and thinking as it pertains to medical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the above lack of clarity, the following assumptions/decisions are made regarding the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `hinselmann`, `schiller`, `citology` and `biopsy` columns indicate a positive result upon carrying out the indicated test for cervical abnormality. I am unable to verify if this column means that the test was merely performed, or whether it was a positive result. The decision to assume that these indicate a postive test result stems from the imbalance of these columns, and knowledge of gynecological care. In the United States at least, pap smears (citology) are reccomended as routine care every 3 years after age 21. It is unlikely that of the nearly 900 patients, only about 6% of them are visiting for their every-three-year citological test. Moreover, the proportion of patients with citology is less than the proportion with biopsy. It seems strange for biopsy to occur in the absence of citology, although I am not a doctor so perhaps I'm wrong here. Thus, I assume that because these patients were deemed high risk, all tests were performed with the corresponding columns then indicating the results of these tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `biopsy` column is used as the outcome variable. This is consistent with the orignal authors' work. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `dx_cancer`, `dx_cin`, `dx_hpv` and `dx` columns indicate any previous cervical abnormality diagnosis has occurred. This is an assumption made based on table 1 in [this](article). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The various columns indicating a particular sexually transmitted disease (STD), e.g., `stds_cervical_condylomatosis` indicate whether the patient *currently* has the indicated disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `stds_n_diagnosis` column is different than the `stds_number` column. I am unable to find any information regarding the `stds_n_diagnosis` column, although it could mean the number of total STD diagnoses in the patients whole history. However, because I cannot verify anything about the `stds_n_diagnosis` column, I am forced to drop it. "

In contrast, if it is unimportant, then shuffling it should result in little or no change in the loss/score. \n",

Notably, after we pass the point-mass at zero packs per year (implying a non-smoker), risk takes a step-function-like increase. It drops down shortly after, but this is likely due to very little data at the higher numbers of packs per year.\n",
