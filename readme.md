# Cervical Cancer Biopsy Model

This is the code to accompany my webpage post on cervical cancer risk classification, available [here](https://jmniehaus.github.io/cervical.html). 

The top-level dependencies are contained in the `environment.yml` file; if desiring to reproduce any analyses, I highly suggest creating a conda environment from this file. The analysis will most likely not work if using past/future versions of the associated packages.
