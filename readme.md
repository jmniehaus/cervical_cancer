# Cervical Cancer Biopsy Model

_This is still under development_. This readme will be updated upon completion of the analysis. 

In general, this project focuses on diagnosing cervical cancer in women using the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Cervical Cancer Risk Factors 
dataset. My ultimate goals are to gain more experience utilizing the various tools for machine learning in Python, as well as more experience solving
common problems encountered in predictive modeling for healthcare data.
